#Unit Testing Project

In the words of the immortal Monty Python: **"And now for something completely different!"**

Up until now, you have written code that met test specs, and you've gotten pretty darn good at it. 
Now it's time to flip that around. 

In this project, you will be provided with three files, each one with various functions and classes already written for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it (which, spoiler alert, you do) is to write the unit tests that will check to see if the code does what it says it does.

The first two files are functions. The third is a file with a class and several class methods that you will need to test.

**Make sure to use your problem solving plan and get testy with it!**
